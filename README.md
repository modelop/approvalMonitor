# approvalMonitor

**Description:**
Checks the status for the required approvals for a given model snapshot

The MLC requires:
1. Creation of Model Approval Notifications. Approvals are received via Jira tickets typically.
2. Requires the approval_type to be set in the governance MLC to ensure that they show up in the model test results.
